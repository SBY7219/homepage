    <h1>Quotes</h1>
    <blockquote>Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. &mdash; George E. P. Box</blockquote>
    <blockquote>An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem. &mdash; John Tukey</blockquote>
    <blockquote>To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of. &mdash; Ronald Fisher</blockquote>
    <blockquote>91.7 percent of all statistics are made-up on the spot. &mdash; Anonymous</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Statisticians, like artists, have the bad habit of falling in love with their models. &mdash; George E. P. Box</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital. &mdash; Aaron Levenstein</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In God we trust. All others must bring data. &mdash; W. Edwards Deming</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future. &mdash; Niels Bohr</blockquote>
    <blockquote>All generalizations are false, including this one. &mdash; Mark Twain</blockquote>
    <blockquote>If you torture the data enough, nature will always confess. &mdash; Ronald Coase</blockquote>
    
    <h1>Insight</h1>
    <blockquote>A big computer, a complex algorithm and a long time does not equal science. &mdash; Robert Gentleman</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write. &mdash; H.G. Wells</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data. &mdash; John Tukey</blockquote>
    <blockquote>There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical routines. &mdash; J.M. Hammersley</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Strange events permit themselves the luxury of occurring. &mdash; Charlie Chan</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Statistics - A subject which most statisticians find difficult but which many physicians are experts on. &mdash; Stephen S. Senn</blockquote>
    <blockquote>He uses statistics like a drunken man uses a lamp post, more for support than illumination. &mdash; Andrew Lang</blockquote>
    
    <h1>Wisdom</h1>
    <blockquote>The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard. &mdash; John Tukey</blockquote>
    <blockquote>It's easy to lie with statistics; it is easier to lie without them. &mdash; Frederick Mosteller</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Everybody believes in the exponential law of errors [i.e., the Normal distribution]: the experimenters, because they think it can be proved by mathematics; and the mathematicians, because they believe it has been established by observation. &mdash; Gabriel Lippmann</blockquote>
    <blockquote>All we know about the world teaches us that the effects of A and B are always different—in some decimal place—for any A and B. Thus asking "are the effects different?" is foolish. &mdash; John Tukey</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Conducting data analysis is like drinking a fine wine. It is important to swirl and sniff the wine, to unpack the complex bouquet and to appreciate the experience. Gulping the wine doesn't work. &mdash; Daniel B. Wright</blockquote>
    <blockquote>... surely, God loves the .06 nearly as much as the .05. Can there be any doubt that God views the strength of evidence for or against the null as a fairly continuous function of the magnitude of p? &mdash; R. L. Rosnow & R. Rosenthal</blockquote>
    <blockquote>On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament], "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?" I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question. &mdash; Charles Babbage</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Statistics is the grammar of science. &mdash; Karl Pearson</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Statistics: the mathematical theory of ignorance. &mdash; Morris Kline</blockquote>
    <blockquote>My thesis is simply this: probability does not exist. &mdash; Bruno de Finetti</blockquote>
